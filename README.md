# Portfolio
## In this repository, you will find code implementations for the following projects:

### Machine Learning (Classification)
This Python-based project involves training, testing, and evaluating multiple classification models. The objective is to identify the most accurate model for classifying breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant based on their characteristics. The dataset, sourced from the University of Wisconsin, is available on Kaggle through the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/roustekbio/breast-cancer-csv. 

### Mathematical Modelling (GAMS)
This GAMS code represents my initial effort to solve a mixed-integer nonlinear optimization model aimed at finding the optimal design for a multi-objective produced water treatment process. The model incorporates two water treatment units and utilizes the weighted-sum method with the Baron Solver. However, due to numerical challenges associated with modeling changes in particle and droplet size distributions of the contaminants, further progress with GAMS was not feasible. Consequently, the problem was implemented and successfully solved using Julia.

### Sales Data Analysis Using Pandas
In this project, Pandas library is used to analyze actual transactions from UK retailers. The analysis starts by exploring the dataset and processing the data to answer seven questions aimed at improving the profitability of the retailers. The dataset can be found on Kaggle using this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data

### Machine Learning (Deep Learning)
This code employs deep learning with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to forecast the likelihood of a customer leaving the bank, considering diverse banking attributes and customer interactions. These features offer insights into customer engagement levels and churn tendencies. The outcomes of the ANNE model developed herein can inform proactive measures to retain at-risk customers. The dataset can be found on Kaggle using this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jssunmathi/churn-modelling
  
### Data Cleaning
This project involves the cleaning and preprocessing of job data scraped from the Glassdoor website. The refined data serves as a foundation for the subsequent project, the Tech Jobs Dashboard. Despite an initial cleaning process, additional refinement was carried out using Python to align with the dashboard's structure. The original dataset is accessible on Kaggle via the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/data-science-job-posting-on-glassdoor.

### Tech Jobs Dashboard
This Power BI Dashboard provides insights into salaries and skills for data-related positions and offers an interface for exploring salary trends and sought-after skills in the tech job market.

### FIFA World Cup in Numbers
This project explored the historical records of FIFA World Cup games spanning from 1930 to 2022. The exploration is facilitated using SQL, addressing 10 specific queries. The dataset can be obtained from Kaggle using this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/fifa-football-world-cup-dataset.

### Desktop Cleaner and Files Organizer
This Python project focuses on decluttering the desktop by relocating all files to a designated folder. Subsequently, it classifies these files into distinct sub-folders based on their types. The code operates in the background, executing scheduled cleaning and organizing tasks through the Task Scheduler.

### Multi-objective Optimization With Julia
This Julia code was developed to design a Produced Water (PW) Treatment System that consists of multiple processing units. PW is the water associated with the extraction of oil and gas and it is the largest waste stream in the oil and gas industry. This code aims to find the optimal design of the processing units and their configuration that minimizes the cost and the emission of the system. The optimization problem was solved using a nature-inspired algorithm called Fresa. This code is one of the contributions of my PhD degree.  


### Data Visualization Using Python 
This Python file includes the code I wrote to visualize the results obtained by implementing the multi-objective optimization code. The figures shown in this file are included in my PhD thesis.
