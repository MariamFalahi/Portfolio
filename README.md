## In this repository, you will find code implementations for the following projects:

### Desktop Cleaner and Files Organizer:
This Python project focuses on decluttering the desktop by relocating all files to a designated folder. Subsequently, it classifies these files into distinct sub-folders based on their types. The code operates in the background, executing scheduled cleaning and organizing tasks through Task Scheduler.
  
### Data Cleaning:
This project involves the cleaning and preprocessing of job data scraped from the Glassdoor website. The refined data serves as a foundation for the subsequent project, the Tech Jobs Dashboard. Despite an initial cleaning process, additional refinement was carried out using Python to align with the dashboard's structure. The original dataset is accessible on Kaggle via the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/data-science-job-posting-on-glassdoor.

### Tech Jobs Dashboard:
This Power BI Dashboard provides insights into salaries and skills for data-related positions and offers an interface for exploring salary trends and sought-after skills in the tech job market.

### FIFA World Cup in Numbers:
This project delves into the historical records of FIFA World Cup games spanning from 1930 to 2022. The exploration is facilitated using SQL, addressing 10 specific queries. The dataset can be obtained from Kaggle using this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/fifa-football-world-cup-dataset.

### Machine Learning (Classification):
This Python-based project involves training, testing, and evaluating multiple classification models. The objective is to identify the most accurate model for classifying breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant based on their characteristics. The dataset, sourced from the University of Wisconsin, is available on Kaggle through the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/roustekbio/breast-cancer-csv.
