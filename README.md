## In this respository you can find the codes for the follwing projects:
  - Desktop cleaner and files organizer
    - In this project we develop a code to move all the files on the desktop to a specific folder and then classify the files into different 
    sub-folders according to their type. The code runs in the computer background to perform the cleaning and organizing tasks according 
    to a pre-define schedule using Task Sceduler.
